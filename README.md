## Overview

This module adds a function `compliance_map()` to the Puppet language. The
`compliance_map()` function provides the ability for users to compare their
in-scope class parameters against a set of *compliant* parameters, either in
Hiera or at the global scope. Users may also provide custom inline policy
documentation and mapping documentation.

The goal of this module is to make it easier for users to both detect, and
report on, deviations from a given policy inside their Puppet codebase.

## Module Description

This module provides the function `compliance_map()` and a `compliance_markup`
class for including the functionality into your stack at the global level.

A utility for converting your old `compliance_map()` Hiera data has also been
included in the `utils` directory.

A custom Hiera backend called `compliance_map` is also available that allows
for the **enforcement** of the compliance map where applicable.

## Upgrading

A utility script, `compliance_map_migrate` has been included in the `utils`
directory of the module to upgrade your old compliance data to newer formats.

At minimum, you must pass to the script a compliance profile to migrate, the
version of the API it *was* compatible with, and the version you wish to migrate
it to.  For instance, to upgrade a compliance map from API 0.0.1 to 1.0.0:

`ruby compliance_map_migrate -i /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/simp/hieradata/compliance_profiles/nist_800_53_rev4.yaml  -s 0.0.1 -d 1.0.0`

Please validate that the migrated YAML files work as expected prior to
deploying them into production.

## Setup

### What compliance_markup affects

By default, the `compliance_map()` function creates a set of reports, one per
node, on your Puppet Server at
`Puppet[:vardir]/simp/compliance_reports/<fqdn>`.

You may optionally enable the creation of a `File` resource on each of your
clients if you with to have changes in this data automatically exported into
`PuppetDB`.

## Usage

The `compliance_map()` function provides a mechanism for mapping compliance
data to settings in Puppet and should be globally activated by `including` the
`compliance_markup` class.

It is primarily designed for use in classes to validate that parameters are
properly set but may also be used to perform a *full* compliance report against
multiple profiles across your code base at compile time.

When the `compliance_markup` class is included, the parameters in all in-scope
classes and defined types will be evaluated against top level parameters,
`lookup()` values, or Hiera data, in that order.

The variable space against which the parameters will be evaluated must be
structured as the following hash:

```
  compliance_map :
    <compliance_profile> :
      <class_name>::<parameter> :
        'identifiers' :
        - 'ID String'
        'value'      : 'Compliant Value'
        'notes'      : 'Optional Notes'
```

For instance, if you were mapping to `NIST 800-53` in the `SSH` class, you
would use something like the following:

```
  compliance_map :
    nist_800_53 :
      ssh::permit_root_login :
        'identifiers' :
        - 'CCE-1234'
        'value'      : false
```

Alternatively, you may use the `compliance_map()` function to add compliance
data to your modules outside of a parameter mapping. This is useful if you have
more advanced logic that is required to meet a particular internal requirement.

**NOTE:** The parser does not know what line number and, possibly, what file
the function is being called from based on the version of the Puppet parser
being used.

The following parameters may be used to add your own compliance data:

```ruby
:compliance_profile => 'A String, or Array, that denotes the compliance
                        profile(s) to which you are mapping.'
:identifiers        => 'An array of identifiers for the policy to which you
                        are mapping.'
:notes              => 'An *optional* String that allows for arbitrary notes to
                        include in the compliance report'
```

### Options

The `compliance_markup` class may take a number of options which must be passed
as a `Hash`.

#### report_types

*Default*: `[ 'non_compliant', 'unknown_parameters', 'custom_entries' ]`

A String, or Array that denotes which types of reports should be generated.

*Valid Types*:
  * *full*: The full report, with all other types included.
  * *non_compliant*: Items that differ from the reference will be reported.
  * *compliant*: Compliant items will be reported.
  * *unknown_resources*: Reference resources without a system value will be
  reported.
  * *unknown_parameters*: Reference parameters without a system value will be
  reported.
  * *custom_entries*: Any one-off custom calls to compliance_map will be
  reported.

#### client_report

*Default*: `false`

A Boolean which, if set, will place a copy of the report on the client itself.
This will ensure that PuppetDB will have a copy of the report for later
processing.

#### server_report

*Default*: true

A Boolean which, if set, will store a copy of the report on the Server.

#### server_report_dir

*Default*: `Puppet[:vardir]/simp/compliance_reports`

An Absolute Path that specifies the location on

#### server_report_dir

*Default*: `Puppet[:vardir]/simp/compliance_reports`

An Absolute Path that specifies the location on the *server* where the reports
should be stored.

A directory will be created for each FQDN that has a report.

## Reference

### Example 1 - Standard Usage

**Manifest**

```ruby
class foo (
  $var_one => 'one',
  $var_two => 'two'
) {
  notify { 'Sample Class': }
}

$compliance_profile = 'my_policy'

include '::foo'
include '::compliance_markup'
```

**Hiera.yaml**

```yaml
:backends:
  - 'yaml'
:yaml:
  :datadir: '/path/to/your/hieradata'
:hierarchy:
  "compliance_profiles/%{compliance_profile}"
  "global"
```

**Hieradata**

```yaml
---
# In file /path/to/your/hieradata/compliance_profiles/my_policy.yaml
compliance_map :
  my_policy :
    foo::var_one :
      'identifiers' :
      - 'POLICY_SECTION_ID'
      'value' : 'one'
```

### Example 2 - Custom Compliance Map

```ruby
if $::circumstance {
  compliance_map('my_policy','POLICY_SECTION_ID','Note about this section')
  ...code that applies POLICY_SECTION_ID...
}
```

## Enforcement

You can use the custom Hiera backend, `compliance_map`, to actually enforce the
values set in the compliance map data structure.

### Installing the Backend

Though the Puppet server **should** pick the backend up from the module, we
have seen some issues with this over time and have had to drop the
`compliance_map_backend.rb` file directly into
`/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/hiera/backend` and then restart
the Puppet server.

### Activating the Backend

The backend is essentially a special YAML backend and can be loaded just like
any other Hiera backend.

The following two examples provide methods by which you may make the values
authoritative or overridable (recommended).

**Hiera.yaml - Overridable**

```yaml
:backends:
  - 'yaml'
  - 'compliance_map'
:yaml:
  :datadir: '/path/to/your/hieradata'
:compliance_map:
  :datadir: '/path/to/your/hieradata'
:hierarchy:
  "compliance_profiles/%{compliance_profile}"
  "global"
```

**Hiera.yaml - Authoritative**

```yaml
:backends:
  - 'compliance_map'
  - 'yaml'
:yaml:
  :datadir: '/path/to/your/hieradata'
:compliance_map:
  :datadir: '/path/to/your/hieradata'
:hierarchy:
  "compliance_profiles/%{compliance_profile}"
  "global"
```

### Selecting Which Profile to Enforce

You may enforce one or more profiles in parallel by setting the globally scoped
variable `$enforce_compliance_profile`.

If you enforce multiple profiles, they should be specified as an Array and
items at the beginning of the Array will override later items.

#### Example 1 - Standard Usage

**Manifest**

```ruby
class foo (
  $var_one => 'one',
  $var_two => 'two'
) {
  notify { 'Sample Class': }
}

$enforce_compliance_profile = 'my_policy'

include '::foo'
```

#### Example 2 - Multi-Profile

**Manifest**

```ruby
class foo (
  $var_one => 'one',
  $var_two => 'two'
) {
  notify { 'Sample Class': }
}

$enforce_compliance_profile = ['my_policy', 'my_less_important_policy']

include '::foo'
```

## Limitations

Depending on the version of Puppet being used, the `compliance_map()` function
may not be able to precisely determine where the function has been called and a
best guess may be provided.

## Development
